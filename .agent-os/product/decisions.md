## 2025-01-23: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

LinkedIn Ingestion Service will be built as an atomic, service-oriented API that focuses exclusively on LinkedIn profile and company data collection and storage, designed to serve as the data foundation for Fortium's candidate and partner evaluation ecosystem.

### Context

Fortium requires comprehensive LinkedIn intelligence for candidate evaluation, partner assessment, and client engagement decisions. Current manual processes are time-intensive and inconsistent. The service needs to integrate with existing workflows on Cassidy AI and support future AI-powered analysis systems including MCP servers.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Monolithic Evaluation System**
   - Pros: Single system to maintain, direct integration
   - Cons: Tight coupling, difficult to scale individual components, mixing data collection with business logic

2. **Manual Process Enhancement**
   - Pros: Low development cost, familiar workflow
   - Cons: Still time-intensive, inconsistent data, doesn't scale

3. **Third-Party LinkedIn API Service**
   - Pros: No development needed, immediate availability
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, limited customization, may not meet specific Fortium requirements

### Rationale

The atomic service approach provides the best balance of focused functionality, integration flexibility, and scalability. By separating data collection from business logic (FIT scoring, matching), we create a reusable foundation that multiple Fortium systems can leverage without tight coupling.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear separation of concerns between data collection and business logic
- Reusable service for multiple Fortium systems
- Easier to maintain and scale individual components
- Better testability and reliability
- Supports future AI/MCP server integration

**Negative:**
- Additional service to deploy and maintain
- Network latency between services
- Requires API design and versioning considerations

## 2025-01-23: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use FastAPI + Supabase pgvector + Railway deployment stack, following established Fortium tech standards with no project-specific overrides.

### Context

LinkedIn Ingestion Service requires high-performance async processing for concurrent profile fetching, vector storage for AI-ready data, and reliable deployment infrastructure. The service will handle potentially large volumes of LinkedIn data and needs to support vector similarity operations.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Django + Traditional PostgreSQL**
   - Pros: Familiar framework, robust ecosystem
   - Cons: Less optimized for async operations, no built-in vector support

2. **Node.js + Pinecone**
   - Pros: JavaScript consistency, specialized vector database
   - Cons: Additional vendor dependency, higher costs, learning curve

### Rationale

FastAPI provides optimal async performance for LinkedIn data fetching, Supabase pgvector offers integrated relational and vector storage, and Railway ensures reliable deployment. This stack aligns with existing Fortium standards and provides all required capabilities.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Leverages existing team knowledge and standards
- Integrated vector and relational data storage
- High-performance async processing
- Automatic API documentation generation

**Negative:**
- Dependency on Supabase for vector operations
- PostgreSQL vector operations may be less optimized than specialized solutions

## 2025-01-23: Service Scope and Boundaries

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Architecture Team

### Decision

LinkedIn Ingestion Service will be responsible ONLY for data collection and storage, with no business logic for FIT scoring, candidate matching, or partner evaluation. All analysis functions will be handled by separate downstream services.

### Context

Clear service boundaries are critical for maintainability and integration flexibility. The temptation exists to include basic analysis features, but this would create coupling with business logic that may change frequently.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Include Basic FIT Scoring**
   - Pros: Single API call for data + analysis
   - Cons: Couples data collection with business logic, harder to modify scoring algorithms

2. **Include Profile Matching**
   - Pros: More complete service offering
   - Cons: Requires knowledge of job requirements, couples with client-specific logic

### Rationale

Maintaining strict service boundaries ensures the LinkedIn Ingestion Service remains focused, reusable, and maintainable. Downstream services can implement their own business logic while leveraging the standardized data foundation.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear service responsibilities
- Easier to maintain and modify independently
- Reusable across multiple business use cases
- Better testability

**Negative:**
- Requires multiple API calls for complete workflows
- Additional complexity in downstream service integration

## 2025-01-23: Data Integration Strategy

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Data Architecture Team, Integration Team

### Decision

Integrate with existing Cassidy AI workflows for LinkedIn data collection, maintaining the current two-workflow approach (profile collection + company collection) within the service architecture.

### Context

Fortium already has functional LinkedIn data collection workflows in Cassidy AI. Rather than rebuilding this capability, we should leverage the existing investment while providing a more structured API layer.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Direct LinkedIn API Integration**
   - Pros: No external dependencies, full control
   - Cons: LinkedIn API restrictions, development complexity, rate limiting challenges

2. **Web Scraping Approach**
   - Pros: More data availability
   - Cons: Legal and ethical concerns, unreliable, detection risks

### Rationale

Leveraging existing Cassidy AI workflows provides proven data collection capability while allowing us to focus on the service architecture, data storage, and API design aspects.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster development timeline
- Proven data collection approach
- Reduced technical risk
- Maintains existing workflow investment

**Negative:**
- Dependency on Cassidy AI platform
- Limited control over data collection methodology
- Potential vendor lock-in for data source
