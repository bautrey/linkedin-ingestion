# LinkedIn Ingestion Project Rules

When working on this project:

## Project Context
- This is a FastAPI project for LinkedIn data ingestion and processing
- The codebase has been recently consolidated and cleaned up (session 2025-08-07)
- All API endpoints are consolidated in `main.py` 
- All 167 tests are consolidated in `app/tests/` directory
- Use `python run_tests.py` to run the test suite

## Development Workflow
- Check `linkedin-ingestion-SESSION_HISTORY.md` for recent work context
- Session files are stored in `sessions/` directory
- Git status shows clean working tree with intentional structural changes

## Architecture Notes
- Removed deprecated API route files from `app/api/routes/*.py`
- Eliminated scattered test files from root directory
- Unified test execution with single runner script
- Ready for V1.85 LLM-based profile scoring implementation

## Testing
- All tests pass after structural consolidation
- Use unified test runner: `python run_tests.py`
- Test directory: `app/tests/`
- Total test count: 167 tests

## Next Development Phase
- Project is ready for V1.85 LLM-based profile scoring
- Codebase is clean and well-organized for future development
