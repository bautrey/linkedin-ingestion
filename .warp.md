# LinkedIn Ingestion Project Rules

When working on this project:

## Project Context
- This is a FastAPI project for LinkedIn data ingestion and processing
- The codebase has been recently consolidated and cleaned up (session 2025-08-07)
- All API endpoints are consolidated in `main.py` 
- All 167 tests are consolidated in `app/tests/` directory
- Use `python run_tests.py` to run the test suite
- Integrated with Supabase for database and API functionality

## Development Workflow
- Check `linkedin-ingestion-SESSION_HISTORY.md` for recent work context
- Session files are stored in `sessions/` directory
- Current work: V1.88 Prompt Templates Management System implementation
- Memory Keeper MCP should be used for all context persistence
- Hybrid AgentOS + WARP.md approach for robust session management

## Memory Management
- Use Memory Keeper MCP to store key entities and relationships
- V1.85 LLM Profile Scoring: COMPLETE (August 12th, 2025)
- Current focus: V1.88 Prompt Templates Management System
- Session hibernation should create timestamped files in sessions/ directory
- Always update SESSION_HISTORY.md for continuity between sessions
- Use Warp Terminal's built-in context through this .warp.md file

## Architecture Notes
- Removed deprecated API route files from `app/api/routes/*.py`
- Eliminated scattered test files from root directory
- Unified test execution with single runner script
- V1.85 LLM-based profile scoring: COMPLETE with OpenAI integration
- V1.88 Prompt templates system: Database-driven template management
- Production-first approach based on V1.85 lessons learned

## Testing
- All tests pass after structural consolidation
- Use unified test runner: `python run_tests.py`
- Test directory: `app/tests/`
- Total test count: 247 tests (with complete V1.85 implementation)
- Always test with virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
