Otherwise, score zero and flag.\n- Invalid: VP Infrastructure, Head of IT, etc.\n- Trajectory: must show progressive leadership. Jumping from Project Manager, Programmer, or consultant to CDO = title inflation, automatically flagged and zero-credit.\n- Key experiences: IT strategy, ERP/CRM, digital transformation, vendor/vendor optimization, spend alignment.\n- Flags: consulting-only, role inflation, downgrade post-CIO, etc.\n\n### Output Format (JSON):\n```\n{\n  \"total_score\": <int 0–100>,\n  \"breakdown\": {\n    \"role_depth\": <points>,\n    \"trajectory_integrity\": <points>,\n    \"industry_experience\": <points>,\n    \"transformation_depth\": <points>,\n    \"certifications\": <points>,\n    \"multiple_roles_bonus\": <points>\n  },\n  \"flags\": [\"maybe title inflation\", \"consulting only post-CIO\", ...],\n  \"justification\": \"Provide concise rationale for scoring and flags.\"\n}\n```"
