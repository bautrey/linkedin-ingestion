# LinkedIn Ingestion - Next Session Continuation Prompt

## Session Recovery Context
**Last Session**: 2025-08-19-074436 (Task 2.3 COMPLETE)
**Project**: linkedin-ingestion
**Current Status**: Ready for Task 3+ implementation

## Quick Session Startup
```bash
cd /Users/burke/projects/linkedin-ingestion

# Start development servers (if needed)
cd admin-ui && npm start &  # Port 3001
cd .. && source venv/bin/activate && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000 &

# Check current status
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

## Context for Next Agent

### What was completed in Task 2.3:
- âœ… Fixed JavaScript infinite recursion in deleteProfile function with proper Bootstrap modal event handling
- âœ… Added complete profile export functionality (CSV/JSON) via `/api/profiles/export` route
- âœ… Enhanced scoring routes to support both single and bulk profile operations
- âœ… Created comprehensive scoring UI templates with progress indicators and notifications
- âœ… All changes committed (commits `cb13cb8`, `e94fea3`, `6cdbfc9`)

### Current System State:
- **Admin UI**: Fully functional profile management with delete, export, and scoring actions
- **Backend API**: Enhanced with export endpoint and improved scoring routes  
- **Database**: All schemas up-to-date, 326 tests passing
- **Git Status**: Clean working tree, 5 commits ahead of origin
- **Servers**: Can be running on ports 3001 (UI) and 8000 (API)

### Ready for Task 3+:
The system is now ready to move beyond basic profile management into advanced features:

1. **Template Management System**: Create, edit, and manage scoring templates for different assessment types
2. **Advanced Scoring Interface**: Custom prompt functionality and enhanced AI-driven assessments  
3. **Bulk Processing Enhancements**: Optimize for large-scale profile operations
4. **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive end-to-end testing of all new features

### Key Files to Review:
- `admin-ui/public/js/profiles-list.js` - Enhanced JavaScript with fixed recursion
- `admin-ui/routes/api.js` - New export functionality
- `admin-ui/routes/scoring.js` - Enhanced scoring routes
- `admin-ui/views/scoring/score-profiles.ejs` - New scoring UI template
- `sessions/linkedin-ingestion-session-2025-08-19-074436.md` - Complete session details

### Architecture Context:
- Profile management flow: UI â†’ JavaScript events â†’ API calls â†’ Database operations â†’ User feedback
- Export functionality: Frontend selection â†’ Backend processing â†’ File generation â†’ Download delivery
- Scoring integration: Template selection â†’ Profile loading â†’ Bulk processing â†’ Results notification

## Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Review completed Task 2.3 work** to understand the current implementation
2. **Test all new features** to verify functionality (deletion, export, scoring)
3. **Begin Task 3 planning** based on template management and advanced scoring requirements
4. **Consider performance optimization** for bulk operations if needed
