# Railway Deployment Guide - LinkedIn Ingestion Service

## üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT RULES

### NEVER USE THESE COMMANDS (THEY HANG):
- `railway logs` (always streams, requires Ctrl+C)
- `railway up` (streams deployment output, hangs at end)
- Any command that streams without explicit termination

### ALWAYS USE THESE INSTEAD:
- `railway status` - shows current project status
- `railway variables` - shows environment variables AND correct URLs
- `railway open` - opens dashboard in browser
- `curl` commands to test endpoints directly

## üéØ Correct Deployment Process

### 1. Find the Correct Railway URL
```bash
# This command shows RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN which is the correct URL
railway variables

# Look for this line:
# RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN ‚îÇ smooth-mailbox-production.up.railway.app
```

**CORRECT URL:** `https://smooth-mailbox-production.up.railway.app`
**WRONG URL:** `https://smooth-mailbox.railway.app` (this doesn't work)

### 2. Deploy Code Changes
```bash
# Railway does NOT auto-deploy on git push
# You must manually trigger deployment:

# ‚ö° STREAMLINED METHOD (90 seconds total):
railway redeploy &
DEPLOY_PID=$!
sleep 60  # Wait for deployment
kill $DEPLOY_PID 2>/dev/null || true
sleep 30  # Wait for container startup

# Alternative methods:
# Method 1: Use railway redeploy (monitor and cancel manually)
railway redeploy

# Method 2: Use railway up with timeout protection
gtimeout 90s railway up || killall railway

# DO NOT USE: railway up without timeout (it hangs indefinitely)
# DO NOT EXPECT: automatic deployment on git push (it doesn't exist)
```

### 3. Wait for Deployment (60+ seconds)
```bash
# Wait for deployment to complete
sleep 60

# Or check status periodically
railway status
```

### 4. Test Deployment
```bash
# Test root endpoint first
curl -s "https://smooth-mailbox-production.up.railway.app/"

# Should return JSON with service info, not Railway's default page

# Test health endpoint
curl -s "https://smooth-mailbox-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/health"

# Test secured endpoint without API key (should return 403)
curl -s -X POST "https://smooth-mailbox-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/profiles/ingest" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/test"}'

# Test secured endpoint with API key (should process request)
curl -s -X POST "https://smooth-mailbox-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/profiles/ingest" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: li_HieZz-IjBp0uE7d-rZkRE0qyy12r5_ZJS_FR4jMvv0I" \
  -d '{"linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/test"}'
```

## üîß Local Testing First

**ALWAYS test locally before deploying:**

```bash
# Start local server
python main.py &

# Wait for startup
sleep 3

# Test locally
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/"
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health"

# Test API security locally
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/profiles/ingest" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/test"}'

# Should return 403 Forbidden

curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/profiles/ingest" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: li_HieZz-IjBp0uE7d-rZkRE0qyy12r5_ZJS_FR4jMvv0I" \
  -d '{"linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/test"}'

# Should process request (may fail on invalid LinkedIn URL)

# Stop local server
kill %1
```

## üìã Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Test changes locally first
- [ ] Commit and push code changes
- [ ] Wait 60+ seconds for deployment
- [ ] Get correct URL with `railway variables`
- [ ] Test root endpoint returns JSON (not Railway default page)
- [ ] Test API endpoints work as expected
- [ ] Test API security (403 without key, processes with key)

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Service returns Railway default page
**Cause:** Testing wrong URL or deployment not complete
**Solution:** 
1. Use `railway variables` to get correct URL
2. Wait longer for deployment to complete
3. Check if Procfile and main.py are correct

### Issue: 404 on all endpoints
**Cause:** App structure issues or import problems
**Solution:**
1. Test locally first to verify app works
2. Check imports in main.py match project structure
3. Verify Procfile points to correct entry point

### Issue: Can't tell if deployment succeeded
**Cause:** Using hanging railway commands
**Solution:**
1. Never use `railway logs` or `railway up`
2. Test with curl commands instead
3. Use `railway variables` and `railway status`

## üîë API Security Configuration

**Generated API Key:** `li_HieZz-IjBp0uE7d-rZkRE0qyy12r5_ZJS_FR4jMvv0I`

**Make.com HTTP Module Settings:**
- **URL:** `https://smooth-mailbox-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/profiles/ingest`
- **Method:** POST
- **Headers:**
  - `Content-Type`: `application/json`
  - `x-api-key`: `li_HieZz-IjBp0uE7d-rZkRE0qyy12r5_ZJS_FR4jMvv0I`
- **Body:** `{"linkedin_url": "{{32.LinkedIn.value}}"}`

## üìù Environment Variables

Key environment variables set in Railway:
- `API_KEY`: `li_HieZz-IjBp0uE7d-rZkRE0qyy12r5_ZJS_FR4jMvv0I`
- All other variables from app/core/config.py

## üéØ Success Indicators

**Deployment is successful when:**
1. Root URL returns JSON service info (not Railway default page)
2. Health endpoint returns status info
3. Protected endpoints return 403 without API key
4. Protected endpoints process requests with correct API key
5. No import errors or application startup failures

**Deployment has failed when:**
1. Railway default page is shown
2. All endpoints return 404
3. Application startup errors in logs (if viewable)
