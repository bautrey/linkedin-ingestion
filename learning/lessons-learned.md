## Session: V1.8 Spec Creation (2025-07-31)

### Key Lessons from V1.8 Spec Creation

#### AgentOS Process Adherence
- ✅ **Feature Branch Created**: `feature/v1.8-fortium-fit-scoring-api` - proper git workflow followed
- ✅ **16-Step AgentOS Process**: Successfully followed complete spec creation process
- ✅ **Complete Spec Structure**: All required files created (spec.md, technical-spec.md, database-schema.md, api-spec.md, tests.md, tasks.md)
- ✅ **Process Integration**: Tasks.md fully integrates AgentOS session management requirements

#### Critical Process Requirements Integrated
- **Session Management**: Every task limited to 30 minutes with hibernation
- **TDD Methodology**: All tests written before implementation (no exceptions)
- **Recovery Protocol**: Read lessons learned mandatory first subtask of every task
- **State Preservation**: Write lessons learned mandatory last subtask of every task
- **Quality Gates**: No task complete until ALL errors/warnings resolved AND production tests pass
- **Live Testing**: Production tests required after every 2-3 subtasks using Railway
- **Frequent Commits**: Git workflow with feature branches and early/frequent pushes

#### V1.8 Technical Architecture Decisions
- **Database-Driven Configuration**: Scoring algorithms and thresholds stored in database for runtime configurability
- **Role-Specific Scoring**: Separate algorithms for CIO, CTO, CISO roles
- **Deterministic Results**: Same inputs must always produce identical outputs
- **Performance Requirements**: <200ms cached, <500ms fresh calculations
- **Comprehensive Response**: Includes category scores, summaries, recommendations, alternative roles

#### Current Project State
- **Test Count**: 163 tests passing (from v1.7 completion)
- **Warnings Policy**: Zero deprecation warnings maintained
- **Production Status**: V1.7 fully deployed and stable on Railway
- **Database**: Supabase with CanonicalProfile models implemented
- **API Security**: API key authentication working correctly

### Lessons from Previous Sessions (Referenced)

#### Critical Bug Fix Patterns
- **Field Mapping Issues**: Always verify field names match between models (.id vs .profile_id, .name vs .full_name)
- **Live Testing Essential**: Issues only surface with real data, not just unit tests
- **Pydantic V2 Compliance**: Use .model_dump() not .dict(), datetime.now(timezone.utc) not datetime.utcnow()

#### Production Testing Patterns
- **Real URLs Required**: Test with actual LinkedIn profiles, not mock URLs
- **Serialization Issues**: HttpUrl fields need string conversion for database storage
- **API Key Security**: Always test both with and without API keys

#### Performance Optimization Learning
- **Company Fetch Delays**: Reduced from 10s to 5s in workflow for better performance
- **Database Connections**: Connection pooling critical for concurrent requests
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses essential for debugging

### Next Session Preparation

#### V1.8 Implementation Session 1 (Task 1: Database Schema)
- **Prerequisites**: Feature branch created, spec complete
- **First Subtasks**: Read this lessons learned file, verify Railway status
- **Focus**: Database migration files with TDD approach
- **Expected Duration**: 30 minutes maximum
- **Hibernation Required**: After Task 1 completion

#### Success Criteria for Next Session
- Database schema created and tested
- Migration files working locally and in production
- Seed data loaded successfully
- All 163 existing tests still passing
- Zero warnings maintained

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### Session Management
- ❌ **Never exceed 30-minute sessions** - context loss and productivity decline
- ❌ **Never skip reading lessons learned** - repeated mistakes and inefficiency
- ❌ **Never proceed with warnings/errors** - technical debt accumulation
- ❌ **Never skip production testing** - live issues go undetected

#### Technical Implementation
- ❌ **Never implement without tests first** - TDD is non-negotiable
- ❌ **Never work directly on main branch** - feature branches mandatory
- ❌ **Never deploy with failing tests** - production stability critical
- ❌ **Never ignore deprecation warnings** - maintenance burden increases

### Process Improvements Identified

#### Session Efficiency
- **Pre-session Setup**: Verify Railway status, check test count, confirm branch
- **Test Baseline**: Always run full test suite before starting new work
- **Incremental Commits**: Commit after every 2-3 subtasks completed
- **Production Validation**: Live testing catches issues unit tests miss

#### Quality Assurance
- **Error Monitoring**: Check for new warnings after every change
- **Performance Tracking**: Measure response times during live testing
- **Data Validation**: Test with real profiles, not only mock data
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflows essential

## Historical Context

### V1.7 Completion Status
- ✅ All tasks completed successfully
- ✅ Field mapping issues resolved (.id → .profile_id, .name → .full_name)
- ✅ Live production testing verified
- ✅ Serialization bugs fixed (HttpUrl handling)
- ✅ Performance optimized (company fetch delay reduced)
- ✅ 100% task completion documented

### Project Foundation Stability
- **Ingestion System**: Fully functional LinkedIn profile ingestion
- **Database**: Stable Supabase setup with proper schema
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints with authentication
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with 163 passing tests
- **Deployment**: Automated Railway deployment pipeline

This solid foundation enables confident v1.8 development with known-good baseline.
