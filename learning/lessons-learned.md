## Session: V1.85 Database Migration Success (2025-08-12)

### CRITICAL: Supabase Production Migration Process - DEFINITIVE APPROACH

**NEVER FORGET**: This process was figured out multiple times - use it every time

#### The ONLY Way to Apply Schema Changes to Production Supabase

**Step 1: Create Migration File**
```bash
# Create migration in supabase/migrations/
supabase migration new [description]
# OR manually create: supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_[description].sql
```

**Step 2: Apply to Production**
```bash
# NEVER use psql, pooler, or connection strings
# ALWAYS use Supabase CLI with production password from .env
source .env
supabase db push --password "$SUPABASE_PASSWORD"
```

**Step 3: Handle PostgreSQL Syntax Issues**
- PostgreSQL does NOT support `CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS`
- Use: `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS [name] ON [table]; CREATE TRIGGER [name]...`
- Always test trigger syntax in migration files

**Critical Commands That DON'T Work**:
- ❌ `psql "postgresql://postgres:password@host:port/db"`
- ❌ `psql -h aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com`
- ❌ Any direct PostgreSQL connection attempts
- ❌ MCP tools or API-based approaches

**The ONLY Command That Works**:
- ✅ `supabase db push --password "$SUPABASE_PASSWORD"` (after sourcing .env)

**Environment Setup**:
```bash
# Check project is linked
supabase projects list
# Should show: ● yirtidxcgkkoizwqpdfv | bautrey's Project

# Verify migration directory exists
ls supabase/migrations/

# Load environment variables (password should be in .env file)
source .env
supabase db push --password "$SUPABASE_PASSWORD"
```

**Password Storage**: In `.env` file as `SUPABASE_PASSWORD=...` (NEVER in documentation files)

#### V1.85 Database Migration Achievement
- ✅ **scoring_jobs table**: Successfully deployed to production Supabase
- ✅ **Production API**: Scoring job creation working (tested with real profile)
- ✅ **PostgreSQL Syntax Fix**: Resolved CREATE TRIGGER compatibility issue
- ✅ **Environment Security**: Password stored properly in .env file
- ✅ **Process Documentation**: Complete step-by-step process recorded

#### V1.85 OpenAI API Key Security Configuration

**CRITICAL LEARNING**: OpenAI API key is stored in Railway environment variables, not in local .env files

**Background**: GitHub applies high security scanning to repositories and will flag OpenAI API keys in code/config files. To prevent this:

**Production Configuration**:
- ✅ **OpenAI API Key**: Set directly in Railway environment variables dashboard
- ✅ **Local Development**: .env file contains placeholder `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here-or-set-in-railway`
- ✅ **Security**: Real key never committed to repository
- ✅ **Deployment**: Railway automatically injects environment variables into production

**Testing Implications**:
- Local tests may use placeholder API key (causing auth failures in tests)
- Production scoring jobs will use real Railway environment variable
- Test failures related to "Incorrect API key provided" are expected in local environment
- This is by design for security compliance

**Railway Environment Variables Setup**:
```bash
# In Railway dashboard > Project > Environment Variables:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-[actual-key-here]
```

**Local Testing with Real Key** (if needed):
```bash
# Temporarily set for testing (never commit)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-[actual-key-here]
python -m pytest tests/test_llm_scoring_service.py
```

## Production Deployment Critical Lessons

### Domain Name Discovery Failure
**CRITICAL ERROR**: Agent incorrectly assumed production domain was `linkedin-ingestion-production.up.railway.app` instead of discovering actual URL `smooth-mailbox-production.up.railway.app`.

**Impact**: 2+ hours of debugging 404 errors due to wrong domain
**Root Cause**: Made assumptions instead of checking Railway dashboard or deployment logs
**Fix**: Always verify actual deployed domain before making API calls

### Local Testing vs Production Reality Gap
**Problem**: All 247 local tests passing gave false confidence that system was production-ready
**Reality**: Production was completely broken due to:
- Race conditions in async job processing not exposed locally
- Import errors (`Experience` vs `CanonicalExperienceEntry`) that worked in local environment
- Status update timing issues between controller and service layers
- Configuration differences between local and deployed environments

**Learning**: Local testing success ≠ production readiness. Need production-first validation approach.

### Async Job Processing Race Condition
**Issue**: Controller updated job status to "processing" before LLM service could process it, causing jobs to fail gatekeeper checks
**Solution**: Remove duplicate status updates, let LLM service handle all status transitions
**Pattern**: Async background tasks need careful coordination between components

### Import Error in Production
**Issue**: `from app.models.canonical.profile import Experience, Education` failed in production
**Root Cause**: Actual class names were `CanonicalExperienceEntry` and `CanonicalEducationEntry`
**Learning**: Production environments can expose import issues that work locally due to Python path differences

## Session: V1.85 Task 4 Completion (2025-08-12) - MAJOR MILESTONE

### CRITICAL SUCCESS: Async LLM Job Processing System Complete

**MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT**: V1.85 Task 4 fully implemented and operational in production

**Overall V1.85 Status**: ~95% Complete - Core implementation fully operational

### Next Priority: Prompt Templates Feature
**Decision**: Before moving to V1.9 (Frontend), implement database-driven prompt templates system

#### Prompt Templates System Design (AgentOS)
```sql
CREATE TABLE prompt_templates (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- 'CTO', 'CIO', 'CISO'
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    prompt_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    version INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb
);
```

#### Implementation Benefits
- **Reusable Prompts**: Store Fortium Partners CTO/CIO/CISO evaluation prompts
- **Version Control**: Track prompt template versions and changes
- **Role-based Organization**: Clean separation of prompts by role
- **Database Integration**: Update scoring job creation to use stored templates
