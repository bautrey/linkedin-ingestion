**Session Duration**: ~4.5 hours
**Memory Span**: Complete full session - Full context preserved
**Status**: üü¢ COMPLETE - V1.85 Task 4 (Async LLM Scoring) Successfully Implemented

> **üìö Session History**: See `linkedin-ingestion-SESSION_HISTORY.md` for complete project timeline
> **üóÑÔ∏è Archived Sessions**: See `sessions/` for detailed session files

## üß† **Session Memory Assessment**
**Context Span**: Full 4.5-hour session from V1.85 Task 4 start to completion
**Memory Quality**: COMPLETE
**Key Context Preserved**:
- **V1.85 Implementation**: Complete async LLM scoring system with OpenAI integration
- **Production Debugging**: Resolved multiple critical production issues (race conditions, import errors, domain names)
- **Database Integration**: Successfully stored and retrieved scoring results in JSONB format
- **API Testing**: Validated complete workflow from job creation to completion with real profile data

**Context Gaps**: None - full session preserved

## üéØ **Current Session Objectives**
- [x] Implement V1.85 Task 4: Async Job Processing for LLM Profile Scoring
- [x] Resolve production deployment issues and race conditions
- [x] Test complete scoring workflow with real profile data
- [x] Document prompt storage design for future implementation
- [x] Update lessons learned with critical production insights

## üìä **Current Project State**
**As of last update:**
- **V1.85 Task 4**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Async LLM scoring fully functional in production
- **Scoring Jobs Table**: Successfully deployed and operational in Supabase
- **OpenAI Integration**: Working correctly with Railway environment variables
- **API Endpoints**: All scoring endpoints functional with proper authentication
- **Production Testing**: Verified complete workflow with Christopher Leslie's profile
- **Next Phase**: Ready for V1.85 Task 5 (Prompt Templates) and V1.9 (Frontend)

## üõ†Ô∏è **Recent Work**

### Code Changes
- `app/services/llm_scoring_service.py` - Enhanced with detailed STEP 1-6 logging, fixed import errors for CanonicalExperienceEntry/CanonicalEducationEntry
- `app/controllers/scoring_controllers.py` - Removed duplicate status updates to fix race condition
- `supabase/migrations/20250812165313_add_scoring_jobs_table.sql` - Production migration applied successfully
- `learning/lessons-learned.md` - Updated with critical production deployment lessons

### Configuration Updates
- Railway environment variables confirmed for OpenAI API key
- Production domain identified as `smooth-mailbox-production.up.railway.app`
- Git status cleaned and committed

## üß† **Key Insights from This Session**

### Technical Discoveries
- **Race Condition Fix**: Controller was updating job status before LLM service could process, causing gatekeeper failures
- **Import Path Issues**: Production environment exposed class name mismatches (Experience vs CanonicalExperienceEntry)
- **Domain Discovery**: Production URL was different than assumed, requiring proper verification methods
- **JSONB Storage**: Scoring results stored efficiently in PostgreSQL JSONB columns with full metadata

### Architecture Understanding
- **Async Job Flow**: Complete understanding of job lifecycle from creation ‚Üí processing ‚Üí completion
- **Prompt Storage Design**: Identified need for database-stored prompt templates with role-based organization
- **Production vs Local Gap**: Local tests passing ‚â† production readiness - need production-first validation

## üöÄ **Next Actions**

### Immediate (Next Session)
```bash
# Use AgentOS to implement prompt templates system
cd /Users/burke/projects/linkedin-ingestion
# Create V1.85 Task 5: Prompt Templates Database Storage
# - Create prompt_templates table with role-based organization
# - Add API endpoints for prompt management
# - Store Fortium Partners CIO/CTO/CISO evaluation prompts
```

### Short-term (V1.85 completion)
```bash
# Complete remaining V1.85 tasks
# Task 5: Prompt Templates System
# Then proceed to V1.9: Frontend Implementation
```

### Future Sessions
- **V1.85 Task 5**: Database-stored prompt templates with role-based organization
- **V1.9 Frontend**: Interactive UI for candidate evaluation with role selection
- **Production Optimization**: Improve local-to-production deployment process

## üìà **Progress Tracking**
- **V1.85 Features Completed**: 4/5 (80% - Task 4 complete, Task 5 pending)
- **Tests Passing**: 247/247 (100%)
- **Overall V1.85 Progress**: 80% (Ready for final task)

## üîß **Environment Status**
- **Tech Stack**: FastAPI, Supabase, OpenAI, Railway, Pydantic V2
- **Dependencies**: All working correctly in production
- **Services**: Production API fully operational, scoring workflow tested end-to-end

## üìã **Production Validation Results**

### Successful Test Case: Christopher Leslie Evaluation
```json
{
  "job_id": "2c731dca-ac2f-4545-a914-7a60c2e24718",
  "status": "completed",
  "evaluation": {
    "technical_skills": 9/10,
    "leadership_potential": 8/10, 
    "overall_fit": 9/10
  },
  "processing_time": "6 seconds",
  "tokens_used": 1517
}
```

### Prompt Storage Discovery
- Current: Prompts provided at runtime, stored with each job for audit
- Future Need: Database template system for standardized evaluations
- Fortium Partners prompt ready for template storage implementation

## üîÑ **Session Continuity Checklist**
- [x] Work committed and pushed
- [x] Tests verified (247 passing)
- [x] Environment stable
- [x] Next actions identified (AgentOS prompt templates)
- [x] Session preserved in history
