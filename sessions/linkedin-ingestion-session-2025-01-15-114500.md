- **Session Management**: Enhanced with WARP.md integration step added to recovery process

## üõ†Ô∏è **Recent Work**

### Major Research Discoveries
- **WARP.md System**: Discovered Warp's native project-scoped rules in `WARP.md` files (all caps)
- **Session Recovery Enhancement**: Added Step 2.5 to session-recovery.md for WARP.md integration
- **Agent Mode Task Lists**: Documented Warp's enhanced task management in Agent Mode
- **Memory Keeper MCP**: Identified session persistence option via MCP tools

### Configuration Updates  
- `session-recovery.md` - Added comprehensive WARP.md recovery step
- Research documented on Warp's agent behavior customization via project rules
- Integration analysis between AgentOS and Warp native features completed

## üß† **Key Insights from This Session**

### Technical Discoveries
- **WARP.md Project Rules**: Warp supports project-specific agent behavior via `WARP.md` files with automatic ancestor directory scanning
- **Rule Precedence**: Project rules override global rules, supporting granular customization per project/directory
- **Agent Mode Enhancement**: Recent Warp updates include interactive code blocks, task lists, and slash commands
- **Session Persistence Options**: Multiple paths for session management including native Warp features + MCP tools

### Architecture Understanding
- **Overlap Analysis**: Significant overlap between AgentOS session management and Warp's native WARP.md capabilities
- **Consolidation Opportunity**: Potential to streamline session management by leveraging Warp built-ins while retaining critical AgentOS features
- **Hybrid Approach Viable**: Can integrate WARP.md as primary project configuration while maintaining AgentOS for complex session hibernation/recovery

## üöÄ **Next Actions**

### Immediate (Next Session)
```bash
# WARP.md Implementation Planning
cd /Users/burke/projects/burke-agent-os-standards
# Review existing AgentOS session hibernation docs thoroughly
# Create detailed comparison matrix: WARP.md vs AgentOS features
# Document warp-learning-system touchpoints and integration opportunities
```

### Short-term (Follow-up Sessions)  
```bash
# Proof of Concept Development
# Create sample WARP.md configurations for typical projects
# Design migration plans from pure AgentOS to hybrid WARP.md + AgentOS approach  
# Test WARP.md rule precedence and behavior in real projects
# Update AgentOS standards to incorporate WARP.md best practices
```

### Future Sessions
- **Hybrid Implementation**: Design and implement consolidated session management using WARP.md + AgentOS
- **Migration Planning**: Create migration guide for existing projects to adopt WARP.md configurations
- **Documentation Updates**: Update all AgentOS documentation to reflect WARP.md integration
- **Standards Evolution**: Evolve AgentOS to complement rather than duplicate Warp's native capabilities

## üìà **Progress Tracking**
- **Research Phase**: 100% COMPLETE - Comprehensive WARP.md discovery and analysis
- **Integration Planning**: 25% - Initial analysis complete, detailed planning needed
- **Implementation**: 0% - Ready to begin hybrid approach development
- **Overall Research**: 100% - Major breakthrough achieved in understanding Warp's native capabilities

## üîß **Environment Status**
- **Tech Stack**: Python/FastAPI, Supabase, AgentOS framework
- **Dependencies**: All operational - template service implemented with tests
- **Services**: Development ready - uncommitted changes preserved for development continuity
- **AgentOS**: Fully integrated with enhanced session recovery supporting WARP.md

## üí° **Critical Research Findings**

### WARP.md System Overview
- **File Name**: `WARP.md` (all caps, not `.warp`)
- **Location**: Project root or subdirectories with ancestor scanning  
- **Purpose**: Project-scoped agent rules and development standards
- **Integration**: Automatic loading in Warp Agent Mode
- **Precedence**: Project rules override global workspace rules

### Integration Opportunities
- **Session Context**: WARP.md can reference AgentOS hibernation/recovery system
- **Rule Consolidation**: Move project-specific rules from claude.md to WARP.md
- **Workflow Enhancement**: Combine Warp's native task lists with AgentOS session management
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain AgentOS's robust session hibernation while leveraging WARP.md for project configuration

### Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Add WARP.md support to session recovery (‚úÖ COMPLETE)  
- **Phase 2**: Create detailed comparison matrix and gap analysis
- **Phase 3**: Design hybrid approach leveraging both systems' strengths
- **Phase 4**: Implement consolidated session management solution
- **Phase 5**: Migrate existing projects to hybrid approach
