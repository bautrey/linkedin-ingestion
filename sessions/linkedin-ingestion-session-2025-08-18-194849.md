**Session Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Memory Span**: Complete short session - Full context preserved
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Profile image feature working

> **üìö Session History**: See `linkedin-ingestion-SESSION_HISTORY.md` for complete project timeline
> **üóÑÔ∏è Archived Sessions**: See `sessions/` for detailed session files

## üß† **Session Memory Assessment**
**Context Span**: Full 30-minute session focused on profile image troubleshooting
**Memory Quality**: COMPLETE
**Key Context Preserved**:
- Profile image troubleshooting: Investigation of why Satya Nadella's profile image wasn't displaying
- Database verification: Confirmed profile_image_url was correctly stored in database
- Backend API verification: Confirmed FastAPI was returning profile data with image URL
- Admin UI configuration issue: Discovered UI was pointing to production Railway deployment instead of local server

**Context Gaps**: None - complete session context maintained

## üéØ **Current Session Objectives**
- [x] Debug profile image display issue for Satya Nadella
- [x] Verify profile image feature implementation end-to-end
- [x] Fix admin UI configuration to use local backend
- [x] Confirm profile images now display correctly in admin UI

## üìä **Current Project State**
**As of last update:**
- **Profile Image Feature**: ‚úÖ FULLY WORKING - End-to-end implementation complete
- **Database Schema**: ‚úÖ Contains profile_image_url column with migration applied
- **Backend API**: ‚úÖ Correctly returns profile image URLs via /api/v1/profiles endpoint
- **Admin UI**: ‚úÖ Now configured to use local FastAPI backend instead of production
- **LinkedIn Ingestion**: ‚úÖ Cassidy adapter extracts and stores profile image URLs
- **Servers**: Both FastAPI (port 8000) and Admin UI (port 3003) running locally

## üõ†Ô∏è **Recent Work**

### Configuration Changes
- `admin-ui/.env` - Updated FASTAPI_BASE_URL from Railway production to http://localhost:8000
- Fixed admin UI to connect to local backend instead of remote deployment

### Troubleshooting Investigation
- **Database Query**: Verified Satya Nadella has correct profile_image_url stored
- **Backend API Test**: Confirmed /api/v1/profiles endpoint returns image URL correctly
- **Admin UI Template**: Verified EJS template has correct image handling logic
- **Root Cause**: Admin UI was querying production backend which didn't have the profile

## üß† **Key Insights from This Session**

### Technical Discoveries
- **Configuration Mismatch**: Admin UI .env file pointed to production Railway deployment
- **Data Consistency**: Profile image data exists in local database but not in production
- **API Integration**: Both backend and frontend code were correct - issue was environment configuration

### Best Practice
- **Environment Consistency**: Always verify frontend and backend are connecting to the same data source
- **Local Development**: Ensure all services point to local endpoints during development

## üöÄ **Next Actions**

### Immediate (Next 15 minutes)
```bash
# Profile image feature is complete and working
# User can now see Satya Nadella's LinkedIn profile photo in the admin UI
# No immediate actions required
```

### Short-term (Future sessions)
```bash
# Optional: Sync profile image data to production deployment
railway run python migrations/sync_profile_images.py  # If needed
```

### Future Sessions
- **Production Deployment**: Consider syncing local profile data to production if needed
- **Bulk Profile Updates**: May want to refresh existing profiles to capture image URLs
- **Performance**: Monitor image loading performance with many profiles

## üìà **Progress Tracking**
- **Profile Image Feature**: COMPLETE (100%) - Working end-to-end
- **Database Migration**: COMPLETE (100%) - Schema updated
- **Backend Integration**: COMPLETE (100%) - API returns image URLs
- **Frontend Display**: COMPLETE (100%) - UI shows profile photos
- **Overall Progress**: Profile image feature fully implemented and functional

## üîß **Environment Status**
- **Tech Stack**: FastAPI backend, Node.js admin UI, Supabase database, Cassidy AI integration
- **Dependencies**: All services operational
- **Services**: 
  - FastAPI server running on localhost:8000
  - Admin UI server running on localhost:3003
  - Both servers configured and functional

## üîÑ **Session Continuity Checklist**
- [ ] Work committed and pushed (uncommitted changes exist - user acknowledged)
- [x] Feature verified working
- [x] Environment stable
- [x] Next actions identified
- [x] Session preserved in history
