# linkedin-ingestion - Session 2025-08-22-171037
**Project**: linkedin-ingestion
**Date**: 2025-08-22
**Session Duration**: ~1 hour
**Memory Span**: Full session context - Complete conversation covering domain extraction debugging
**Status**: üî¥ **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED** - Cassidy Company Workflow Integration Broken

> **üìö Session History**: See `linkedin-ingestion-SESSION_HISTORY.md` for complete project timeline
> **üóÑÔ∏è Archived Sessions**: See `sessions/` for detailed session files

## üß† **Session Memory Assessment**
**Context Span**: Full conversation covering domain extraction issue investigation and critical discovery
**Memory Quality**: COMPLETE
**Key Context Preserved**:
- Domain extraction issue investigation and fixes implemented
- Production API access established and tested
- Critical discovery: Cassidy company workflow not being called since 6:24 AM

**Context Gaps**: None - full session context available

## üéØ **Current Session Objectives**
- [x] Investigate "Domain: <empty>" errors in LinkedIn company data extraction
- [x] Locate and access production API for testing
- [x] Test profile ingestion pipeline end-to-end
- [x] **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Identified root cause - company workflow integration broken
- [ ] Fix broken Cassidy company workflow integration (deferred to next session)

## üìä **Current Project State**
**As of last update:**
- **Production API**: `https://smooth-mailbox-production.up.railway.app` - Accessible with API key
- **Domain Extraction Helpers**: Implemented in `linkedin_pipeline.py` with URL parsing fallback
- **Company Workflow Integration**: ‚ùå **BROKEN** - No calls since 6:24 AM (6+ hours ago)
- **Profile Workflow**: Status unknown (needs verification)

## üõ†Ô∏è **Recent Work**

### Code Changes
- `app/services/linkedin_pipeline.py` - Added domain extraction helper functions:
  - `_extract_domain_from_company_data()` - Direct domain field extraction
  - `_extract_domain_from_experience()` - Domain parsing from company website URLs
  - Updated `_extract_company_data_from_profile()` to use new helpers
  - Fixed syntax error in experience company extraction loop
- `app/database/embeddings.py` - Minor updates
- Admin UI company display components updated

### Configuration Updates
- Confirmed production API URL and API key access
- Verified environment variables and deployment configuration

## üß† **Key Insights from This Session**

### Technical Discoveries
- **Root Cause Identified**: The "Domain: <empty>" errors were a symptom, not the actual problem
- **Real Issue**: Cassidy company workflow integration is completely broken - hasn't been called since 6:24 AM
- **Domain Extraction**: Helper functions implemented but may be irrelevant if company workflow isn't running

### Architecture Understanding
- Production pipeline is accessible but missing critical company data fetching
- Profile ingestion appears to start but company processing is not happening
- Recent code changes may have broken the company workflow integration flow

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUE DETAILS**

### Problem Statement
The LinkedIn ingestion pipeline is **NOT calling the Cassidy company workflow** at all since 6:24 AM this morning (now noon - 6+ hours).

### Evidence
- Timeline gap: Last successful company workflow call at 6:24 AM
- Profile ingestion test showed response but no company processing
- Domain extraction fixes are irrelevant without company data

### Impact
- No company profiles are being created or updated
- LinkedIn profiles lack complete company information
- Business intelligence and contact enrichment severely impacted

## üöÄ **Next Actions**

### Immediate (Next session startup)
```bash
# 1. Activate virtual environment first
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Investigate company workflow integration
grep -r "CASSIDY_COMPANY_WORKFLOW_URL" app/services/
grep -r "_fetch_company_profile" app/services/linkedin_pipeline.py

# 3. Check recent changes that broke company workflow
git log --oneline --since="8 hours ago" -- app/services/linkedin_pipeline.py

# 4. Test company workflow endpoint directly
curl -X POST "$CASSIDY_COMPANY_WORKFLOW_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: li_HieZz-IjBp0uE7d-rZkRE0qyy12r5_ZJS_FR4jMvv0I" \
  -d '{"linkedin_url":"https://linkedin.com/company/microsoft"}'
```

### Short-term (This session)
```bash
# 5. Compare current vs working version of company workflow integration
git show HEAD~1:app/services/linkedin_pipeline.py | grep -A 10 -B 10 "company"

# 6. Test profile ingestion with company processing enabled
curl -X POST "https://smooth-mailbox-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/profiles/enhanced" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: li_HieZz-IjBp0uE7d-rZkRE0qyy12r5_ZJS_FR4jMvv0I" \
  -d '{"linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/[test-profile]", "suggested_role": "CTO"}'

# 7. Monitor Railway logs during ingestion
railway logs
```

### Future Sessions
- **Fix Company Workflow Integration**: Restore proper Cassidy company workflow calls
- **Verify End-to-End Pipeline**: Test complete profile + company processing flow
- **Monitor Production Health**: Ensure stable company data ingestion

## üìà **Progress Tracking**
- **Domain Extraction Helpers**: ‚úÖ Completed (may be irrelevant)
- **Company Workflow Integration**: ‚ùå **BROKEN** - Highest priority fix needed
- **Production API Access**: ‚úÖ Established
- **Issue Root Cause**: ‚úÖ Identified (company workflow not being called)

## üîß **Environment Status**

- **Dependencies**: Virtual environment available (`source venv/bin/activate`)
- **Services**: Production API accessible, company workflow broken
- **API Access**: `li_HieZz-IjBp0uE7d-rZkRE0qyy12r5_ZJS_FR4jMvv0I`
