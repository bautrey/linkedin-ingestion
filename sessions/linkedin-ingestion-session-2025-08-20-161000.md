**Memory Span**: Full session - Complete context preserved
**Status**: üü¢ READY FOR CONTINUATION - Critical company integration discovery

> **üìö Session History**: See `linkedin-ingestion-SESSION_HISTORY.md` for complete project timeline
> **üóÑÔ∏è Archived Sessions**: See `sessions/` for detailed session files

## üß† **Session Memory Assessment**
**Context Span**: Full 2-hour session from 19:00-21:00 UTC
**Memory Quality**: COMPLETE - Full conversation context maintained
**Key Context Preserved**:
- **Template System**: Fixed "Failed to fetch" errors and enhanced validation
- **Architecture Clarification**: Local admin UI + remote Railway backend/Supabase
- **Company Data Discovery**: Found critical gap in company data storage/usage
- **System Status**: All core functionality working properly

**Context Gaps**: None - complete session memory available

## üéØ **Current Session Objectives**
- [x] Fix template creation "Failed to fetch" error
- [x] Clarify system architecture (local vs remote components)
- [x] Enhance template form validation and UX
- [x] Investigate company data storage and usage
- [x] Identify critical scoring context gaps
- [ ] Design and implement Company model (deferred to next session)

## üìä **Current Project State**
**As of last update:**
- **Admin UI**: Local development (localhost:3003) - fully functional
- **Backend API**: Remote Railway (https://smooth-mailbox-production.up.railway.app) - stable
- **Database**: Remote Supabase production instance - operational
- **Templates**: CRUD operations working, validation enhanced
- **Scoring**: Basic functionality working, missing company context

## üõ†Ô∏è **Recent Work**

### Code Changes
- `public/js/templates-form.js` - Enhanced validation, error handling, redirect logic
- `routes/scoring.js` - Fixed hardcoded empty data, now pulls real scoring jobs
- `routes/api.js` - Added template testing endpoint with mock data
- `views/templates/form.ejs` - Fixed HTML entity encoding issues
- `views/scoring/score-profiles.ejs` - Improved custom prompt validation

### Configuration Updates
- `.env` - Verified correct Railway backend URL configuration
- Server restart procedures - Improved background process management

## üß† **Key Insights from This Session**

### Critical Discovery: Company Data Gap
- **Problem**: Cassidy retrieves rich company data but we're only storing basic info
- **Impact**: Missing critical scoring context (employee_count: 284478, industries, locations, etc.)
- **Example Data**: 
  ```json
  {
    "employee_count": 284478,
    "employee_range": "10001+", 
    "industries": ["Professional Services"],
    "specialties": "Assurance, Tax, Advisory",
    "funding_info": {...},
    "locations": [...]
  }
  ```

### Architecture Understanding
- **Clear Separation**: Local admin UI development + remote production backend
- **Data Flow**: Cassidy ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí Supabase ‚Üí Admin UI
- **Integration Point**: Company data is retrieved but not properly stored/used

## üö® **CRITICAL NEXT SESSION PRIORITY: Company Model Integration**

### **Current State Analysis:**
1. **Cassidy**: ‚úÖ Already retrieving full company data from LinkedIn
2. **Backend Model**: ‚ùå Likely missing Company model to receive/store this data  
3. **Database**: ‚ùì Company table probably exists in Supabase but unused
4. **API Integration**: ‚ùå Not pulling company data back with profiles
5. **Scoring Context**: ‚ùå Missing critical company context for accurate scoring

### **Integration Architecture Decision Needed:**
**Option 1: Embedded Company Data in Profile Responses**
- Pull full company data with each profile API call
- Pros: Single API call, all context available for scoring
- Cons: Larger response sizes, potential data duplication

**Option 2: Separate Company API Calls**
- Profile returns company IDs, separate calls for company details
- Pros: Cleaner separation, smaller profile responses
- Cons: Multiple API calls required, more complex frontend logic

**Recommendation**: **Option 1** - Embed full company data in profile responses for scoring purposes. The company context is essential for accurate executive evaluation.

### **Immediate Technical Tasks:**
1. **Backend**: Create/verify Company model can receive Cassidy's rich data
2. **Database**: Verify company table schema matches Cassidy output structure  
3. **Ingestion**: Update profile ingestion to store company data separately
4. **API**: Modify profile endpoints to include full company context
5. **Scoring**: Update prompts to utilize company size, industry, employee count
6. **Admin UI**: Display company context in profile views and scoring interfaces

### **Scoring Impact:**
Current scoring treats "CTO at 50-person startup" same as "CTO at 284K-employee PwC" - this is a major accuracy problem that company context will solve.

## üöÄ **Next Actions**

### Immediate (Next 15 minutes)
```bash
# Investigate current backend Company model
grep -r "Company" app/models/  # Check if model exists
grep -r "company" app/schemas/ # Check schema definitions
```

### Short-term (This session)
```bash
# Database schema investigation  
# Check Supabase company table structure
# Verify ingestion pipeline for company data
# Test company API endpoints
```

### Future Sessions
- **Company Model Implementation**: Design proper data model for rich company data
- **Scoring Enhancement**: Update templates to use company context
- **Admin UI Updates**: Display company information in profile views
- **PartnerConnect Integration**: Use rich company data for work history

## üìà **Progress Tracking**
- **Features Completed**: Template CRUD (100%), Basic Scoring (80%), Admin UI (90%)
- **Tests Passing**: Core functionality verified manually
- **Overall Progress**: 75% (Missing company integration for complete scoring accuracy)

## üîß **Environment Status**
- **Tech Stack**: FastAPI + Supabase + Node.js Express + EJS
- **Dependencies**: All stable, no issues detected
- **Services**: Admin UI running locally (localhost:3003), backend on Railway

## üîÑ **Session Continuity Checklist**
- [x] Work committed and pushed
- [x] Tests verified (manual testing completed)
- [x] Environment stable (admin UI + backend operational)
- [x] Next actions identified (company integration priority)
- [x] Session preserved in history
- [x] Critical architecture gap documented
