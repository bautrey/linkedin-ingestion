**Project**: linkedin-ingestion
**Date**: 2025-08-04
**Session Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Memory Span**: Full session context available
**Status**: üü¢ COMPLETE - URL normalization bug fix deployed to production

> **üìö Session History**: See `linkedin-ingestion-SESSION_HISTORY.md` for complete project timeline
> **üóÑÔ∏è Archived Sessions**: See `sessions/` for detailed session files

## üß† **Session Memory Assessment**
**Context Span**: Full 45-minute session (URL bug fix focused)
**Memory Quality**: COMPLETE
**Key Context Preserved**:
- **URL Normalization Bug**: Identified and fixed URLs without protocol failing validation
- **Production Deployment**: Successfully deployed fix and verified with real API call
- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive test suite for URL normalization
- **Complete Fix**: Fixed both ProfileIngestionRequest and ProfileCreateRequest models

**Context Gaps**: None - full session context maintained

## üéØ **Current Session Objectives**
- [x] Identify URL normalization bug (www.linkedin.com/in/user format failing)
- [x] Demonstrate the bug with clear test case showing validation error
- [x] Implement fix using Pydantic field_validator with mode='before'
- [x] Add comprehensive test coverage for URL normalization scenarios
- [x] Fix both ProfileIngestionRequest and ProfileCreateRequest models
- [x] Deploy to production and verify fix works with real API call
- [x] Session hibernation preparation for V1.8 Task 2 continuation

## üìä **Current Project State**
**As of hibernation:**
- **URL Bug Fix**: ‚úÖ DEPLOYED - Both request models now normalize URLs without protocol
- **Production API**: ‚úÖ WORKING - Tested with www.linkedin.com/in/reginaldacloque successfully
- **Test Suite**: ‚úÖ 204 tests passing including 4 new URL normalization tests
- **Git State**: ‚úÖ CLEAN - All changes committed and pushed to master
- **V1.8 Progress**: Ready to continue with Task 2 (Scoring Engine Core Implementation)

## üõ†Ô∏è **Major Work Completed This Session**

### URL Normalization Bug Fix
- **Problem Identified**: URLs like "www.linkedin.com/in/user" were failing Pydantic HttpUrl validation
- **Root Cause**: Missing protocol scheme required by HttpUrl validator
- **Solution**: Added @field_validator with mode='before' to normalize URLs by adding https://
- **Models Fixed**: Both ProfileIngestionRequest and ProfileCreateRequest

### Test Coverage Added
- **New Test File**: `app/tests/test_url_normalization.py` with 4 comprehensive tests
- **Test Scenarios**: URLs without protocol, with protocol, whitespace trimming, non-LinkedIn URLs
- **All Tests Passing**: 204/204 tests pass with zero warnings

### Production Deployment
- **Commits**: 2 commits with URL normalization fix
- **Railway Deployment**: Auto-deployed and verified working
- **Real API Test**: Successfully ingested profile with problematic URL format
- **Production Response**: Full profile data returned correctly

## üß† **Key Insights from This Session**

### Technical Discoveries
- **Pydantic Validation Order**: field_validator with mode='before' runs before HttpUrl validation
- **URL Normalization Strategy**: Simple string manipulation before validation is effective
- **Production Testing**: Always verify fixes with real API calls, not just unit tests
- **Request Model Consistency**: Both API models needed the same fix

### Problem-Solving Process
- **Bug Demonstration**: Showed clear failing test first to establish the problem
- **Systematic Fix**: Applied fix to both models that needed it
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added edge cases and multiple scenarios
- **Production Verification**: Confirmed fix works in real environment

## üöÄ **Next Actions**

### Immediate (Next Session Start)
```bash
cd /Users/burke/projects/linkedin-ingestion
source venv/bin/activate
cat .agent-os/current-session-state.txt  # Read current context
# Begin V1.8 Task 2: Scoring Engine Core Implementation
```

### Short-term (V1.8 Task 2 Session)
```bash
# Continue with V1.8 Task 2 Subtask 2.1: Session Recovery & Context Verification
# Verify V1.8 database schema deployed and 200+ tests passing
# Begin Subtask 2.2: Scoring Engine Models (TDD approach)
```

### Future Sessions
- **V1.8 Task 2**: Scoring Engine Core Implementation (models, algorithm loading, core logic)
- **V1.8 Task 3**: API Endpoint Implementation 
- **V1.8 Task 4**: Role-Specific Scoring Algorithms

## üìà **Progress Tracking**
- **URL Bug Fix**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Production deployed and verified
- **Tests Passing**: 204/204 (added 4 new URL normalization tests)
- **V1.8 Task 1**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Database schema deployed
- **V1.8 Task 2**: Ready to begin - Scoring engine implementation

## üîß **Environment Status**
- **Tech Stack**: FastAPI, Supabase, Railway, Python 3.11+, 204 pytest tests
- **Dependencies**: All working, zero warnings maintained
- **Services**: Railway deployment healthy, production API responding correctly
- **API Key**: li_HieZz-IjBp0uE7d-rZkRE0qyy12r5_ZJS_FR4jMvv0I

## üîÑ **Session Continuity Checklist**
- [x] URL normalization bug completely fixed and deployed
- [x] All tests passing (204/204)
- [x] Production API verified working with fixed URL format
- [x] All changes committed and pushed to master
- [x] Next V1.8 Task 2 actions identified and ready
- [x] Session preserved in history

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes for Next Session**
- **URL Bug**: Now FIXED - both ProfileIngestionRequest and ProfileCreateRequest handle URLs without protocol
- **Production Verified**: API successfully processes "www.linkedin.com/in/user" format URLs
- **V1.8 Context**: Task 1 complete, Task 2 ready with database schema deployed
- **Test Count**: Increased from 200 to 204 tests with URL normalization coverage
