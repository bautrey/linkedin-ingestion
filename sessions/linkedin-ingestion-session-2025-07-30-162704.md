- [x] Complete Task 5.2: Implement robust handling of edge cases
- [x] Update tasks.md to reflect completed work
- [x] Ensure all tests pass (159/159 passing)
- [x] Commit and push all changes

## 📊 **Current Project State**
**As of last update:**
- **CassidyAdapter**: Enhanced with comprehensive edge case handling and data cleaning
- **Test Suite**: 159 tests passing (including 8 new edge case tests)
- **Git State**: Clean working tree, all changes committed and pushed
- **Task Progress**: Tasks 5.1 and 5.2 completed, Tasks 5.3-5.6 remaining

## 🛠️ **Recent Work**

### Code Changes
- `app/adapters/cassidy_adapter.py` - Enhanced with robust edge case handling:
  - Added `_clean_funding_data()` method for data sanitization
  - Improved experience/education transformers with null safety
  - Added type checking and validation for nested data
  - Enhanced company transformation with empty object filtering
- `app/tests/test_cassidy_adapter.py` - Added comprehensive edge case test class:
  - Test for null values in arrays
  - Test for empty strings in education entries
  - Test for empty nested objects in company data
  - Test for mixed data types handling
  - Test for invalid year formats
  - Test for very large arrays (performance)
  - Test for Unicode and special characters
  - Test for deeply nested null values

### Configuration Updates
- `agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-v1.7-cassidy-canonical-adapter/tasks.md` - Marked Tasks 5.1 and 5.2 as completed

## 🧠 **Key Insights from This Session**

### Technical Discoveries
- **Pydantic Model Behavior**: Pydantic v2 models with all optional fields create instances with None values even when no data is provided, rather than returning None
- **Edge Case Patterns**: Common edge cases include null arrays, empty strings, mixed data types, and deeply nested null values
- **Data Cleaning Strategy**: Implementing dedicated cleaning methods for complex nested data structures improves maintainability

### Architecture Understanding
- **Adapter Pattern**: The CassidyAdapter successfully handles data transformation with robust error handling
- **Test Strategy**: Comprehensive edge case testing requires covering null values, empty collections, type mismatches, and boundary conditions
- **Integration Points**: Edge case handling must be considered at every level of data transformation

## 🚀 **Next Actions**

### Immediate (Next 15 minutes)
```bash
# Continue with Task 5 remaining items
cd /Users/burke/projects/linkedin-ingestion
source venv/bin/activate
# Review Task 5.3: Add comprehensive logging for adapter operations and errors
```

### Short-term (This session)
```bash
# Task 5.3: Implement comprehensive logging
# Add logging statements to adapter operations
# Test logging with different log levels
# Verify log output in test environment
```

### Future Sessions
- **Task 5.3**: Add comprehensive logging for adapter operations and errors
- **Task 5.4**: Test adapter with real Cassidy API responses from test suite fixtures
- **Task 5.5**: Verify production deployment works with adapter integration
- **Task 5.6**: Verify all edge case and production tests pass

## 📈 **Progress Tracking**
- **Features Completed**: 4/5 major task groups completed
- **Tests Passing**: 159/159
