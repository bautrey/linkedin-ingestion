# Future Feature Ideas

## Template Versioning System (V2.0+)
*Moved from V1.9 scope due to over-engineering concerns - 2025-08-20*

### Original Concept:
- Template version history and comparison
- Version rollback capabilities  
- A/B testing between template versions
- Template usage analytics per version

### Why Deferred:
- Current need is simple: one template per role that gets replaced when updated
- Versioning adds complexity without immediate business value
- Core scoring functionality needs to work reliably first

### Future Implementation Notes:
- Consider after core admin UI is stable and heavily used
- May want to implement as separate "Advanced Template Management" feature
- Should include user feedback on whether template history is actually needed

## Other Future Considerations:
- Bulk profile import/export
- Advanced scoring analytics
- Company-centric profile browsing
- Mobile responsive improvements
- Real-time collaborative template editing
