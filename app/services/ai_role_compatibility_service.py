AI Role Compatibility Check Service

This service provides Stage 3 of the Quality Gates pipeline by performing
lightweight AI-powered role compatibility checks before expensive detailed scoring.

Purpose:
- Quick sanity check: "Does this profile make sense as a [ROLE] candidate?"
- Auto-role detection: If submitted role fails, try other roles (CTO->CIO->CISO)
- Prevent mismatched scoring (e.g., CIO profile scored against CISO prompt)
- Save costs by avoiding detailed scoring on obviously wrong role matches
