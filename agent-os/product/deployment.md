# Production Deployment Status

## Current Production Environment

**Platform**: Railway  
**Project Name**: smooth-mailbox  
**Production URL**: https://smooth-mailbox.railway.app  
**Status**: ‚ùå **DOWN** (as of 2025-07-24)

## Health Check Endpoints

- **Health Check**: `/api/v1/health`
- **Full URL**: https://smooth-mailbox.railway.app/api/v1/health
- **Expected Response**: HTTP 200 with health status JSON

## Quick Deployment Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs --follow

# Deploy latest changes
git push origin main && railway up

# Test production health
curl https://smooth-mailbox.railway.app/api/v1/health
```

## Environment Configuration

Production environment variables are managed through Railway dashboard:
- `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Database connection
- `CASSIDY_PROFILE_WORKFLOW_URL` - Profile scraping workflow
- `CASSIDY_COMPANY_WORKFLOW_URL` - Company scraping workflow

## Recent Issues Identified

### Model Validation Updates (2025-07-24)
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: ExperienceEntry model aligned with actual API response
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Added missing fields: `duration`, `is_current`, `job_type`, `skills`, `title`
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Backward compatibility properties maintained
- üîÑ **Needs Deploy**: Model fixes need to be pushed to production

### Data Completeness
- Sample LinkedIn profile shows **90.7% completeness** (39/43 fields populated)
- This should no longer be flagged as "incomplete data"
- Rich data includes: profile details, company info, experience history, education

## Next Steps

1. **Redeploy with Model Fixes**: Push updated models to production
2. **Verify Health Checks**: Ensure service starts correctly
3. **Test Data Ingestion**: Validate profile processing with real data
4. **Monitor Performance**: Check response times and error rates

## Local Development

```bash
# Start locally for testing
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Test local health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
```
