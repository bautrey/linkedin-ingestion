# V1.9 Basic Admin UI - Testing and QA Plan

e **Feature**: Basic Admin UI Testing Strategy
e **Version**: 1.9.0
e **Created**: 2025-07-31
e **Status**: ðŸš§ DRAFT - QA Planning in Progress

## Overview

This testing plan defines the approach, coverage, resources, and processes for testing the V1.9 Basic Admin UI feature. It is designed to ensure that all functional and non-functional requirements are met and that the system performs as expected in all anticipated use cases.

### Key Testing Goals
- **Functional Validation**: Ensure all UI components work as intended across all CRUD operations for profiles and companies.
- **Integration Testing**: Verify interactions between the UI and FastAPI backend.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Confirm the application meets business objectives and user needs.

## Test Strategy 

### Core Testing Types

- **Unit Testing**: Focus on individual components using Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Integration Testing**: Validate integration of components and APIs using Playwright.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Test complete user workflows with cross-browser coverage using Playwright.
- **Performance Testing**: Evaluate load times and responsiveness using Lighthouse.
- **Security Testing**: Assess access controls, data protection, and potential vulnerabilities.

### Test Environments

- **Local Development**: Daily testing via developer workflow.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing through GitHub Actions.
- **Staging Environment**: Pre-production environment validation using realistic data.

## Test Cases 

### UI Component Tests
- **Profile List View**:
  - Rendering and pagination
  - Searching and filtering behavior
  - Loading and error states

- **Profile Detail View**:
  - Data display and accuracy
  - Edit and delete operations
  - Navigation and linked data

- **Company Management**:
  - Company search and filter functionality
  - Detail view data cohesion
  - Profile-company linkage

### Integration Tests
- **API Communication**:
  - Endpoint request validation
  - Error handling and retry logic

- **Data Consistency**:
  - Read/write operations consistency
  - Synchronization with backend responses

- **User Interaction**:
  - Form submission and validation
  - CRUD operation flow and feedback

### Performance Metrics
- **Initial Load Time**: Ensure c 2 seconds for home landing.
- **Search Execution Time**: Maintain c 500ms for response.
- **UI Responsiveness**: Confirm smooth navigation and scrolling.

## Quality Criteria

### Functional Acceptance Criteria
- **100% Feature Coverage**: All user-facing features tested and working.
- **95% Test Pass Rate**: High reliability of passes in test iterations.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with meaningful feedback.

### Non-Functional Criteria
- **Consistency**: Uniform interface across browsers and resolutions.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling increased load efficiently.
- **Accessibility**: Level AA support for WCAG compliance.

## Reporting 

### Test Results Evaluation
- **Daily Summary Reports**: Automated daily updates in the CI workflow.
- **Critical Bug Alerts**: Immediate notification of high-priority bug detections.
- **Weekly Metrics Review**: Weekly analysis of test metrics and coverage.

### Issue Management
- **Bug Tracking System**: Utilize Linear for tracking and managing issues.
- **Priority Labeling**: Assign priorities based on user impact and risk level.
- **Resolution Tracking**: Document steps for reproducing, fixing, and verifying fixes.

## Continuous Improvement

### Test Automation Expansion
- Add new test scenarios for emerging edge cases.
- Increase coverage in less-tested areas.
- Regularly update and refactor test code for maintainability.

### Feedback Loops
- Incorporate feedback from testers and users after UAT.
- Regular reviews of test coverage and results with development team.
