  - [ ] 7.1 Extend existing /health endpoint to include template system status
  - [ ] 7.2 Add template database connectivity validation to health checks
  - [ ] 7.3 Include basic template CRUD functionality validation in health check
  - [ ] 7.4 **PRODUCTION HEALTH VERIFICATION**: Confirm health endpoint shows template system
  - [ ] 7.5 Test health check endpoint returns template_system: healthy status
  - [ ] 7.6 Verify monitoring can detect template system issues

## Production-First Implementation Strategy

### Critical Production Validation Points

**Task 1 (Database)**: 
- Deploy migration to production Supabase within first work session
- Immediately verify table creation and default templates exist
- Test database connectivity and basic queries in production

**Task 4 (API Endpoints)**:
- Deploy template API endpoints to production Railway immediately after implementation  
- Test all CRUD operations against production database
- Verify API key authentication and error responses

**Task 5 (LLM Integration)**:
- Test complete end-to-end template-based scoring in production
- Verify Christopher Leslie profile can be scored using default CTO template
- Confirm scoring job creation and completion with template metadata

### Implementation Sequence

```
Session 1: Database Foundation (Tasks 1-2)
- Create and deploy migration to production
- Implement and validate Pydantic models
- Verify production database connectivity

Session 2: Service Layer (Task 3)  
- Implement TemplateService
- Test against production database immediately
- Validate all CRUD operations work in production

Session 3: API Layer (Task 4)
- Implement controllers and API endpoints
- Deploy to production Railway immediately 
- Test all endpoints against production environment

Session 4: Integration (Tasks 5-7)
- Extend scoring system for template integration
- Test complete workflows in production
- Verify health monitoring and cleanup
```

### Success Criteria

Each task must meet these production-readiness criteria:

1. **Functionality Verified**: Feature works correctly in production environment
2. **Error Handling Tested**: Error scenarios validated with real production responses  
3. **Performance Acceptable**: Response times meet existing API performance standards
4. **Monitoring Integrated**: Health checks and basic monitoring in place
5. **Tests Comprehensive**: Both local and production validation tests pass

### Production Environment Details

- **Database**: Supabase production instance (existing connection)
- **API**: Railway auto-deploy from git repository  
- **Authentication**: Existing x-api-key system (li_HieZz-IjBp0uE7d-rZkRE0qyy12r5_ZJS_FR4jMvv0I)
- **Testing Profile**: 435ccbf7-6c5e-4e2d-bdc3-052a244d7121 (Christopher Leslie)

### Risk Mitigation

- **Database Changes**: Migration includes rollback plan if issues occur
- **API Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility for existing scoring endpoints
- **Performance Impact**: Template operations designed to have minimal performance impact
- **Production Testing**: All major functionality tested in production before considering complete

This production-first approach ensures that the template system is not just locally functional but genuinely production-ready, addressing the historical gap between local testing and production deployment.
