# Profile Sorting Implementation Spec

**Date:** 2025-08-23  
**Version:** 2.1.1  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  

## Problem Statement

Frontend admin UI sorting functionality was broken due to missing backend API support for sorting parameters. UI was making requests with `sort_by` and `sort_order` parameters that were being ignored by the backend API.

## Evidence of Issue

- Admin UI logs showed repeated requests with sorting parameters: `?sort_by=company&sort_order=asc`, `?sort_by=name&sort_order=asc`, etc.
- Backend API wasn't accepting or processing these parameters
- Database layer had limited sorting field whitelist that didn't match UI requirements

## Solution Implemented

### Backend API Changes
- ✅ Added `sort_by` and `sort_order` parameters to FastAPI `/api/v1/profiles` endpoint
- ✅ Updated ProfileController.list_profiles method to accept and pass sorting parameters
- ✅ Expanded database layer valid_sort_fields to include all UI-requested fields

### Database Layer Changes
- ✅ Enhanced `_apply_sorting` method with comprehensive field support
- ✅ Added JSON field sorting support for `current_company->name`
- ✅ Added field aliases (`company` → `current_company->name`, `location` → `city`)

### Supported Sort Fields
- Basic fields: `name`, `position`, `city`, `created_at`, `timestamp`
- JSON fields: `current_company`, `company`, `location` (with special handling)
- Profile attributes: `url`, `about`, `suggested_role`, `followers`, `connections`, `country_code`, `profile_image_url`, `linkedin_id`

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- ✅ `/main.py` - FastAPI endpoint parameter addition
- ✅ `/app/database/supabase_client.py` - Database sorting expansion

### Documentation
- ✅ API documentation updated with comprehensive sort field list

## Deployment

- ✅ Deployed to Railway production
- ✅ Verified service health post-deployment
- ✅ Frontend sorting functionality now working

## Outcome

Frontend admin UI sorting functionality is now fully operational. Users can sort profiles by any available field with proper backend support.
