> Created: 2025-08-20
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Build comprehensive admin UI interfaces for company data management, visualization, and analysis, enabling business users to explore the rich company information captured by the backend and make informed decisions about candidate assessment and partner engagement opportunities.

## User Stories

### Company Discovery and Exploration

As a **Business Development Analyst**, I want to browse and search companies in our database with filtering by industry, size, and location, so that I can identify potential client companies and understand our candidate pipeline's company diversity.

**Detailed Workflow:** Access company list view with sortable columns (name, employee count, industry, location), apply filters for employee ranges ("10001+", "501-1000"), search by industry keywords ("Professional Services", "Technology"), and drill down into individual company profiles to see detailed information including funding status, locations, and associated profiles.

### Company-Profile Relationship Analysis

As a **Business Development Analyst**, I want to see which profiles in our database have worked at specific companies, so that I can understand our talent pool's exposure to particular industries and company types for targeted client engagement strategies.

**Detailed Workflow:** From a company detail page, view all profiles who have worked at that company with position titles and employment dates, filter by current vs past employees, and click through to individual profiles to assess candidates who have experience at companies similar to our clients.

### Profile Enhancement with Company Context

As a **Business Development Analyst**, I want profile detail pages to show rich company information for each work experience entry, so that I can quickly assess a candidate's background quality without manually researching each company they've worked for.

**Detailed Workflow:** View profile detail page with work experience section enhanced to show company employee counts, industries, funding status, and company descriptions inline, enabling rapid assessment of candidate experience quality and relevance to client requirements without leaving the profile page.
