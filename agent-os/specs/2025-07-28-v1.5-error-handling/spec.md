# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Enhanced Error Handling
> Created: 2025-07-28
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Improve the LinkedIn Ingestion Service API error responses by replacing generic 500 errors with meaningful, actionable HTTP status codes and detailed error messages that help system integration developers quickly understand and resolve issues.

## User Stories

### Meaningful Error Responses

As a system integration developer, I want to receive specific HTTP status codes and detailed error messages when API requests fail, so that I can quickly understand what went wrong and how to fix it without needing to analyze server logs.

**Detailed Workflow**: When a profile ingestion fails due to invalid LinkedIn URL format, the API should return a 400 Bad Request with a specific error message like "Invalid LinkedIn URL format. Expected format: https://linkedin.com/in/username" rather than a generic 500 Internal Server Error.

### Graceful Duplicate Handling

As a business development analyst, I want duplicate profile scenarios to return clear guidance on how to proceed, so that I can choose whether to update existing profiles or skip duplicates without encountering system errors.

**Detailed Workflow**: When attempting to ingest a profile that already exists, the system should return a 409 Conflict with options like "Profile already exists. Use force_update=true to update existing profile or check GET /api/v1/profiles/{id} for current data."

### API Integration Support

As a system integrator, I want consistent error response formats across all endpoints, so that I can build reliable error handling logic in my integration code.

**Detailed Workflow**: All error responses should follow a standard format with error codes, human-readable messages, and actionable suggestions in a consistent JSON structure.

## Spec Scope

1. **HTTP Status Code Standardization** - Replace 500 errors with appropriate 4xx/5xx status codes based on error type
2. **Detailed Error Messages** - Provide specific, actionable error descriptions instead of generic messages
3. **Consistent Error Format** - Implement standardized error response structure across all endpoints
4. **Error Code System** - Add machine-readable error codes for programmatic error handling
5. **Validation Error Enhancement** - Improve Pydantic validation error responses with clear field-level feedback

## Out of Scope

- Complete API response format overhaul
- Authentication/authorization error handling improvements
- Rate limiting implementation
- External service error handling (Cassidy API, Supabase)

## Expected Deliverable

1. API endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 409, 422, 500) based on error conditions
2. Error responses include specific, actionable error messages with suggested resolutions
3. All error responses follow a consistent JSON structure with error codes and descriptions
4. Validation errors provide clear field-level feedback for request format issues
5. Integration tests verify all error scenarios return expected status codes and messages
