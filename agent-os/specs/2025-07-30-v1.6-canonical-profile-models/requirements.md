# v1.6 Canonical Profile Models - Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Clean Data Model Design (F1)
- **F1.1**: Create `CanonicalProfile` model with normalized field names and proper data types
- **F1.2**: Create `CanonicalCompany` model with consistent structure
- **F1.3**: Use precise data types for all fields (datetime, enums, int, float, etc.)
- **F1.4**: Define proper nullable vs required fields based on real-world data patterns
- **F1.5**: Include comprehensive field documentation and examples

### 2. Pydantic V2 Compliance (F2)
- **F2.1**: All models must use Pydantic V2 syntax exclusively
- **F2.2**: Remove all deprecation warnings
- **F2.3**: Use `ConfigDict` instead of `Config` class
- **F2.4**: Use proper field definitions with `Field()` for validation
- **F2.5**: Implement proper serialization/deserialization methods

### 3. Data Schema Normalization (F3)
- **F3.1**: Consistent naming conventions (snake_case for internal use)
- **F3.2**: Proper data structure for nested objects (work experience, education)
- **F3.3**: Standardized date/time handling (ISO format strings)
- **F3.4**: Consistent handling of optional vs required fields
- **F3.5**: Proper validation rules for URLs, email addresses, etc.

### 4. Forward Compatibility (F4)
- **F4.1**: Models must be extensible for future fields
- **F4.2**: Support for additional metadata fields
- **F4.3**: Version field for model evolution tracking
- **F4.4**: Proper handling of unknown fields from future data sources

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance (NF1)
- **NF1.1**: Model validation must be fast (< 10ms for typical profile)
- **NF1.2**: Serialization/deserialization optimized for API responses
- **NF1.3**: Memory-efficient field definitions

### 2. Code Quality (NF2)
- **NF2.1**: 100% type hints coverage
- **NF2.2**: Comprehensive docstrings for all fields and models
- **NF2.3**: Clean separation from external API dependencies
- **NF2.4**: Follow Python naming conventions and best practices

### 3. Testing (NF3)
- **NF3.1**: Unit tests for all validation rules
- **NF3.2**: Serialization/deserialization round-trip tests
- **NF3.3**: Edge case testing for optional fields
- **NF3.4**: Performance benchmarks for large profiles

### 4. Maintainability (NF4)
- **NF4.1**: Clear model structure that's easy to understand
- **NF4.2**: Proper field grouping and logical organization
- **NF4.3**: Minimal dependencies on external libraries
- **NF4.4**: Future-proof design for schema evolution

## Technical Constraints

### 1. Dependencies (TC1)
- **TC1.1**: Must use Pydantic V2 (>=2.0.0)
- **TC1.2**: Compatible with Python 3.11+
- **TC1.3**: No breaking changes to existing API responses (initially)
- **TC1.4**: Must coexist with current Cassidy models during transition

### 2. Data Integrity (TC2)
- **TC2.1**: All validation rules must be enforceable
- **TC2.2**: No data loss during conversion processes
- **TC2.3**: Proper error messages for validation failures
- **TC2.4**: Consistent behavior across all model instances

### 3. Integration (TC3)
- **TC3.1**: Must integrate with existing database schema
- **TC3.2**: Compatible with current test infrastructure
- **TC3.3**: No impact on current production endpoints
- **TC3.4**: Prepare foundation for v1.7 adapter implementation

## Success Criteria

### 1. Implementation Complete (SC1)
- All canonical models created and tested
- Zero Pydantic V1 deprecation warnings
- Comprehensive test coverage (>95%)
- Documentation complete with examples

### 2. Quality Standards (SC2)
- All type hints validated by mypy
- Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- Code review approved
- All tests passing in CI/CD

### 3. Future Readiness (SC3)
- Clear migration path to canonical models
- Adapter interface defined for v1.7
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Extensible design validated with test cases

## Out of Scope

### Current Release (v1.6)
- **Actual migration** from Cassidy models to Canonical models (v1.7)
- **Database schema changes** (will be handled in migration)
- **API response format changes** (initially use adapter pattern)
- **Performance optimization** beyond basic requirements
- **Advanced validation rules** that require external service calls

### Future Considerations
- Integration with other data sources beyond Cassidy
- Advanced profile matching and similarity algorithms
- Real-time profile update mechanisms
- Advanced caching strategies for model instances

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Migration Complexity (R1)
- **Risk**: Canonical models may not capture all nuances of Cassidy data
- **Mitigation**: Thorough analysis of existing data patterns, comprehensive testing

### 2. Performance Impact (R2)
- **Risk**: Additional model layer may introduce latency
- **Mitigation**: Performance benchmarking, optimization of critical paths

### 3. Data Loss (R3)
- **Risk**: Canonical models may lose important data during conversion
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive field mapping analysis, validation testing

### 4. Adoption Resistance (R4)
- **Risk**: Development team may resist using new models
- **Mitigation**: Clear documentation, gradual migration plan, training materials
