## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Route Handlers**
- Dashboard route returns correct template and data structure
- Profile routes handle pagination parameters correctly
- Company routes handle search and filtering parameters
- API proxy routes forward requests with proper headers

**API Client**
- HTTP client configuration includes proper authentication headers
- Request interceptors log requests appropriately
- Response interceptors handle errors and log responses
- Error handling provides meaningful error messages

**Utility Functions**

- Data validation functions properly validate user inputs
- Helper functions for pagination calculate correct offsets

### Integration Tests

**FastAPI Backend Integration**
- Profile listing fetches data successfully from FastAPI
- Profile detail views retrieve complete profile data
- Company listing integrates properly with backend endpoints
- Error responses from backend are handled gracefully

**Template Rendering**
- EJS templates render with correct data
- Partial templates (header, sidebar, footer) render correctly

- Navigation active states work across different pages

**WebSocket Communication**
- Socket.io connection establishes successfully
- Real-time profile update notifications work correctly
- Dashboard counters update via WebSocket events
- Connection status indicators reflect actual connection state

### Feature Tests

**Dashboard Functionality**

- Navigation between companies and profiles works bidirectionally

### Mocking Requirements

- **FastAPI Backend:** Mock HTTP responses for predictable testing scenarios
- **WebSocket Events:** Mock Socket.io events for real-time feature testing
- **File System:** Mock file operations for environment configuration testing
- **Time-based Tests:** Mock Date.now() for consistent timestamp testing
