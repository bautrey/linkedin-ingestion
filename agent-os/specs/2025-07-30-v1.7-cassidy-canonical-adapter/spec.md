# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: v1.7 Cassidy-to-Canonical Adapter
> Created: 2025-07-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

This spec outlines the creation of an adapter layer that decouples our system from Cassidy's specific API format by transforming its responses into our internal canonical data models. This ensures long-term flexibility to switch data providers without requiring a full application rewrite.

## User Stories

### Decoupling Data Ingestion from External APIs

As a System Architect, I want to abstract the LinkedIn data ingestion process, so that we can easily swap out data providers like Cassidy without impacting the core application logic. This will involve creating a flexible adapter that transforms external API data into our `CanonicalProfile` and `CanonicalCompany` models.

### Ensuring Data Quality and Completeness

As a Backend Developer, I want to implement a data transformation process that flags incomplete or missing data from external APIs, so that we can ensure all required fields in our canonical models are populated. This involves creating a robust validation system within the adapter to maintain data integrity.

## Spec Scope

1. **Cassidy Adapter Module**: Create a new Python module (`app/adapters/cassidy_adapter.py`) responsible for transforming Cassidy API responses.
2. **Canonical Model Transformation**: Implement transformation logic to map Cassidy's response fields to our `CanonicalProfile` and `CanonicalCompany` Pydantic models.
3. **Error Handling for Missing Data**: Implement a system to detect and flag when essential data is missing from the Cassidy API response, preventing incomplete canonical models from being created.
4. **Integration with Ingestion Workflow**: Update the existing data ingestion workflow to use the new adapter instead of directly processing Cassidy's response format.

## Out of Scope

- **Support for Other Data Providers**: This spec is focused solely on the Cassidy adapter. Future adapters for other services will be handled in separate specs.
- **API Endpoint Changes**: No changes will be made to the existing API endpoints or their request/response contracts. This is a purely internal refactoring.
- **Database Schema Changes**: This work will use the existing database schema and canonical models without modification.

## Expected Deliverable

1. A fully functional Cassidy-to-Canonical adapter that successfully transforms Cassidy API responses into our internal canonical models.
2. An updated data ingestion workflow that is fully decoupled from the Cassidy API format.
3. A robust error handling system that prevents the creation of incomplete canonical models when essential data is missing from the API response.
