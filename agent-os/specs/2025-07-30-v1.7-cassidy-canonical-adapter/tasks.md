  - [x] 4.2 Update LinkedInWorkflow.process_profile() to use CassidyAdapter.transform()
  - [x] 4.3 Update workflow error handling to catch and log IncompleteDataError
  - [x] 4.4 Write tests verifying API endpoints unchanged after adapter integration
  - [x] 4.5 Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
  - [x] 4.6 Verify all integration tests pass

- [x] 5. **Edge Case Handling and Production Readiness**
  - [x] 5.1 Write tests for edge cases (empty arrays, null values, missing objects)
  - [x] 5.2 Implement robust handling of optional fields and edge cases
  - [x] 5.3 Add comprehensive logging for adapter operations and errors
  - [x] 5.4 Test adapter with real Cassidy API responses from test suite fixtures
  - [x] 5.5 Verify production deployment works with adapter integration
  - [⚠️] 5.6 Verify all edge case and production tests pass

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

- [ ] 6. **Fix Remaining Field Mapping Issues**
  - [ ] 6.1 Fix failing test: `TestDataExtraction::test_extract_profile_data_success` (KeyError: 'name')
  - [ ] 6.2 Fix failing test: `test_data_extraction_methods` (assert 'name' in profile_data)
  - [ ] 6.3 Update all tests to use consistent field names (name -> full_name)
  - [ ] 6.4 Complete comprehensive field mapping configuration review
  - [ ] 6.5 Verify all 163 tests pass (currently 2 failing)

- [ ] 7. **Complete Live API Testing**
  - [ ] 7.1 Identify correct production API endpoint for live testing
  - [ ] 7.2 Conduct end-to-end live API workflow validation
  - [ ] 7.3 Validate company URL preservation and fetching workflow
  - [ ] 7.4 Test real LinkedIn URLs with production API
  - [ ] 7.5 Document live testing results and any additional issues

**COMPLETION STATUS**: ~85% - Core adapter working but critical field mapping issues remain
